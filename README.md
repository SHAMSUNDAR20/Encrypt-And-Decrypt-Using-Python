# Encryption and Decryption Using Python

## Overview

This Python project provides a basic implementation for encrypting and decrypting data. It uses a chosen encryption algorithm to secure sensitive information, offering a simple and straightforward tool for developers and users who need to protect their data.

## Features

- **Encryption:** Securely encrypt data using a chosen encryption algorithm.
  
- **Decryption:** Easily decrypt previously encrypted data to retrieve the original information.

- **Algorithm Choices:** Users can select from various encryption algorithms based on their security requirements.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/encryption-decryption-python.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd encryption-decryption-python
    ```

### Usage

1. **Encrypt Data:**

    ```bash
    python encrypt.py
    ```

    Follow the prompts to enter the data you want to encrypt.

2. **Decrypt Data:**

    ```bash
    python decrypt.py
    ```

    Enter the encrypted data when prompted, and the original information will be displayed.

### Configuration

Adjust the settings in the `config.json` file, such as the encryption algorithm or key, to tailor the behavior of the encryption and decryption process.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvement, open an issue or submit a pull request to enhance the functionality or security of the encryption and decryption process.
